# Trellis Deployment Guide
#### For Customer Use
This document explains how to deploy and update the Trellis application using the files provided to you. The application consists of two parts:
- **Backend** — deployed from a prebuilt Docker image
- **Frontend** — deployed from your repo

* * *
### 1. Contents of the Package
The ZIP file you received contains:

```text
trellis-app/
├─ trellis-backend/
│   └─ render.yaml/
├─ trellis-frontend/
│	└─ render.yaml
├─ Trellis-Deployment-Guide.md
└─ Trellis-Deployment-Guide.pdf

```

The backend is provided as a Docker image hosted in GHCR:
```text
ghcr.io/oxanashva/trellis-backend:latest
```
* * *
### 3. Deploying the Application on Render
#### Step 1 - Prepare a Git Repository
You can use GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
The repository should contain exactly the files from the package.
Commit and push these files to your repository.
### Step 2 - Add Container Registry Credentials
1. Log in to your Render account: [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Go to **Settings** in **My Workspace**
3. Click **Add Credentials** in **Container Registry Credentials**
4. Fill out the fields:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Name | GHCR |
| Registry | GitHub |
| Username | oxanashva |
| Personal Access Token | Provided GHCR Token |

#### Step 3 — Create a Backend Blueprint from your Repository
1. Log in to your Render account: [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Go to **Blueprints**
3. Click **New Blueprint Instance**
4. Fill out the fields:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blueprint Name | Trellis-Backend |
| Branch | main |
| Blueprint Path | trellis-backend/render.yaml |

5. Setting Environment Variables:
Render will show a notification that some environment variables are missing.
You must fill these in before deploying.

#### Backend Variables
| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| MONGO_URL | Your MongoDB connection string |
| DB_NAME | Name of the database |
| SECRET | Any random secret string used for authentication |
| NODE_ENV | Already set to `production` |

6. Click **Deploy Blueprint**

* * *
#### Prepare frontend build
1. Go to **My Workspace → trellis-backend service** and copy its URL
2. Send the **trellis-backend service URL** and  **Cloudinary Cloud Name** (e.g. `da9dfrthc`) to our support to prepare the frontend build for you
3.  Extract files from provided **build** zip folder
4.  Navigate to the **trellis-frontend** folder in your **trellis-app** repository
5.  Click **Add Files** button and drag the **build** folder
6.  Commit changes
7.  The folder structure after upload should be as follows:
```text
trellis-app/
├─ trellis-backend/
│   └─ render.yaml/
├─ trellis-frontend/
│   ├─ build/
│	└─ render.yaml
├─ render.yaml
├─ Trellis-Deployment-Guide.md
└─ Trellis-Deployment-Guide.pdf

```

#### Step 4 — Create a Frontend Blueprint from your Repository
1. Log in to your Render account: [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Go to **Blueprints**
3. Click **New Blueprint Instance**
4. Fill out the fields:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blueprint Name | Trellis-Frontend |
| Branch | main |
| Blueprint Path | trellis-frontend/render.yaml |

5. Click **Deploy Blueprint**

### 5. Deployment Order
To ensure everything works correctly:
- Deploy **trellis-backend** first
- Wait until it shows **Live**
- Copy the backend URL
- Paste it into `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend environment variables
- Deploy **trellis-frontend**
Your application will now be fully operational.
---
### 6. Updating the Application
You will periodically receive updates in one of two forms:
- A **new backend Docker image**
- A **new frontend build folder**

#### Updating the Backend
When you receive a new backend version, you will be told whether:
- The `latest` tag has been updated, or
- A new tag is available (e.g., `8a27e53`)

To redeploy:
- Open the **trellis-backend** service in Render
- Click **Manual Deploy → Deploy latest reference**
If a new tag is provided:
- Go to **Settings → Deploy → Image → Edit**
- Replace the image URL with the new tag
- Save changes
- Click **Manual Deploy → Deploy latest reference**
Render will pull the new image and restart the service.
---
#### Updating the Frontend
When you receive a new frontend version, you will receive a new `build/` folder.
To redeploy:
- Open **trellis-frontend** in Render
- Go to **Settings → Static Site**
- Upload the new `build/` folder
- Save changes
- Click **Manual Deploy → Clear Cache & Deploy**
The updated frontend will go live immediately.
---
### 7. Troubleshooting
#### Backend not responding
- Ensure all backend environment variables are filled in
- Check that MongoDB credentials are correct
- Redeploy the backend manually
#### Frontend not connecting to backend
- Confirm VITE_API_URL contains the correct backend URL
- Redeploy the frontend after updating the variable
#### Build not updating
- Use Clear Cache & Deploy instead of a normal deploy

### 8. Support
If you need assistance with deployment or updates, please contact your Trellis project provider.
